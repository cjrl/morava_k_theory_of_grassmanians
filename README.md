# Morava K Theory of Grassmannian 

This repository contains my research code for directly calculate the 2-local Margolis Homology of the real Grassmaninains. These calculations supported my [dissertation](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/h702q715z) and a few papers.

Mostly written in Python 3.3 using the Sage library and GAP for the group theory. Much of the code involves Groebner Basis calculations.

This code was parllelized and then sent over to the [UVA HPC cluster](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/).
