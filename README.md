# Morava K Theory of Grassmannians

This repository contains my research code for directly calculate the 2-local Margolis Homology of the real Grassmaninains. Also calculates a lowerbound using Chromatic Fixed Point theory. Together these yield a calculation of the rank of the 2-local Morava K-theory. These calculations supported my [dissertation](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/h702q715z) and a few papers. 

Mostly written in Python 3.3 using the Sage library and GAP for the group theory. Much of the code involves Groebner Basis calculations.

This code was parallelized and then sent over to the [UVA HPC cluster](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/).
